                <p>Young students and working professionals living in apartments located in urban areas of India struggle to follow healthy eating habits and experience poor cooking habits 
                    which leads to generating food waste and unhealthy lifestyles because they often are occupied with long working hours, cook in incorrect quantities, resort to a cheaper option in 
                    online and physical stores and lack information as to what's helpful to them. Hence, there is a need to tackle this issue in India by providing an
                    accessible and efficient system that provides to the needs of such a target audience by ensuring the system is sustainable and efficient. </p>

                    validate and evaluate those assumptions in a better manner.

                    has helped me put the insights gathered in a better perspective and gave me more clarity in the direction that I must follow next.

                        required to do household chores, activities, etc. on 
                        a regular normal day revolving around food habits. 
                        This map has helped me identify at a personal 
                        level, how I behave and what my daily schedule is 
                        like especially the activities that revolve around my 
                        food habits.
                        To every activity, I mapped out what was valuable 
                        and non-valuable for that particular time and 
                        activity. This has helped me identify the pros and 
                        cons of every activity I perform on a regular day at 
                        an hourly level which also helped me identify not 
                        only where I am creating and not creating value, 
                        but also when and how. This has also helped me 
                        identify at what times I am active to do efficient

                    their problems which would help

                        felt was most relevant to the problem that I was trying to solve for my target audience of ages 18-28</p>
                    
                    <img src="/images/InABox/Stage3-3_Deliverable.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <img src="/images/InABox/Stage3-4_Deliverable.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <p>This concept is a service based platform which works on 
                        a subscription model that not only helps you have a 
                        better diet, consume more nutritious food but also save 
                        your energy and time by supplying best groceries on a 
                        weekly basis while you track its information, recipe, 
                        details, etc. through the app.</p> </br> 
                    <p>The idea is that usually farm producers, urban farmers 
                        growing in their personal farms, backyards, etc. and 
                        people who buy surplus food by mistake, often find it 
                        difficult to consume their food in time. 
                        This is a concept to build a bridge by helping anyone who 
                        would like to contribute their supply on this platform 
                        which is then collected by the platform in an inventory 
                        where segregation, cleaning and clustering happens. 
                        After this the inventory creates best meal boxes of homecooked recipes and distributes this to its users. If any 
                        waste generated, by the users, the waste is then 
                        collected and distributed and sent to suppliers with 
                        producing thus maintaining a circular design system 
                        where the platform takes care of the logistics. </p> </br>
                        <p>Not only is the system community based, but also the 
                        interactions happening in the app where the people who 
                        have subscribed connect to othre farm producers, diet 
                        specialists, etc. to understand, learn and grow their healthy 
                        lifestyle.</p> </br>
                        <p>The interaction is also aimed to be gamified, giving a sense 
                            of authority and achivement to its users and suppliers and 
                            also fun and interactive. 
                            At any time, if the person feels like skipping a meal, and 
                            going to a restaurant he can do so by simply pausing a 
                            meal, which then carries forward to the next week at no 
                            extra charges!</p> </br>
                        <p>How this concept defines my problem statement is by 
                            valuing and then minimising the time spent on choosing, 
                            sourcing and cooking the users meals by at the same time 
                            being sustainable. Efficiency is given importance here and 
                            with also information as to habits and data on how the 
                            meals are being consumed and in what quantitites. It also 
                            makes managing personal lifestyle habits more easier with 
                            the help of resources, and information given and curated by 
                            professionals.</p> </br>

                    <p class="strong">Visual Language</p>
                    <p>The visual language was inspired by 
                        farmer’s market where the colours
                        are heavily influenced and aimed to 
                        reflect providing care, being 
                        friendly and being knowledgeable. </p> <br>
                        
                        <p>The typography used is also inspired by shapes that we see at a farmer’s markets (mostly vegetables and 
                            fruits) and developed a more curvy and circular type, hence I chose Poppins</p>

                            <p>The Logo is inspired by sustainable  methods used in a farmer’s market. I have been inspired by how in a 
                                vegetable market, fruits and vegetables are segregated in compartments in boxes, and wanted to replicate something similar to 
                                that. </p>
